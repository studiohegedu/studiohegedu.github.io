Barb is an exceptional musician and a truly gifted violin teacher. Her deep passion for music shines through in every lesson, making her an essential mentor for students of all levels.

                <p>My teenage daughter has been studying violin with Barb for several years now and I feel very fortunate to have found such an outstanding teacher. Musically, my daughter is coming along beautifully and I can see/hear great progress. Barb always thinks many steps ahead with a vision as to what each student can achieve as well as a plan for how to get them there. In addition, she is flexible and happy to provide and support a variety of musical opportunities for her students. For one, she readily coached my daughter in preparing for school orchestra performances, and for another, she linked her to opportunities for chamber music both inside and outside her studio.
                    <br><br>
                    For me and my daughter, though, the lessons are about so much more than “just” music. Barb has established an excellent rapport and relationship with my daughter that allows her to feel comfortable, remain motivated, and increase her confidence. In my opinion, Barb is one of those rare, special music teachers that any student from beginner to highly advanced would be lucky to have.</p>

                <span class="review__stars">★★★★★</span>
                <p>Barb is an amazing violin teacher. Our daughter has been with her for 3 years and she has instilled in her a love of violin and she absolutely adores her and describes Barb as : "warm, caring, kind, welcoming and funny". She is always looking forward to her lessons with Barb. Our son also started violin with her when he was 7 and Barb was able to keep a very energetic 7 year old engaged, which has also nurtured his love of violin.
                    <br><br>
                    From the parental standpoint, Barb is always available and will make time to discuss anything with us. We appreciate the motivation that Barb instills in both of our children, they always come away wanting to practice and improve.
                    <br><br>
                    Last summer, Barb created a summer violin camp which our daughter attended, she had so much fun that she wants to do it again next year if Barb decides to offer this activity again.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you Barb, we appreciate your dedication to teaching our children violin, it's amazing to see the progress they have made.</p>

                <p>
                    I’ve had the privilege of studying at Studio Hegedu for almost six years, and I can’t express enough how much Barb has helped me grow as a musician. From the very beginning, she has been an incredible teacher being patient, knowledgeable, and truly dedicated to her students.
                    <br><br>
                    Barb has an amazing ability to break down complex techniques and concepts, making them accessible and understandable, no matter your skill level. Over the years, she’s tailored her lessons to my individual progress, consistently challenging me to improve while always fostering a positive and encouraging environment. Whether it's mastering a difficult passage or exploring new musical styles and techniques, Barb’s guidance has been invaluable.
                    <br><br>
                    The studio itself is a welcoming and supportive space, and the sense of community she creates among her students makes it a special place to learn. Barb is not only a fantastic teacher, but also a mentor who genuinely cares about her students’ musical and personal growth.
                    <br><br>
                    I can't recommend Studio Hegedu enough. Barb has made such a difference in my musical journey, and I’m incredibly grateful for all her help over the years!

                <p>
                    Where do I even begin? I truly cannot capture Barbara’s essence in a review! As a very gifted violinist, her technical expertise and musicality are second to none. She could easily be a concert master performing for thousands of people a night in Europe. But what truly sets Barbara apart is her ability to translate her remarkable talent into inspiring, personalized teaching that resonates with students of all levels. Barbara’s teaching approach is not only thoughtful and encouraging but also deeply effective. She has an innate ability to identify areas of growth while always fostering confidence and passion in her students. Whether you are just beginning your violin journey or are looking to refine your skills, Barbara meets you where you are and helps you achieve your goals in a supportive and motivating environment.
                    <br><br>
                    What I appreciate most is how Barbara connects with each of her students on a personal level. She genuinely cares about their progress and well-being, making every lesson a positive and enriching experience. Her enthusiasm for music is contagious, and her patience and dedication ensure that every student feels seen and valued.
                    <br><br>
                    For anyone looking for a violin teacher who combines exceptional talent with unmatched teaching skills, Barbara is the perfect choice. I’ve grown tremendously under her guidance, and I know others will too.

                <p>
                    Whether you are an advanced student or a beginner, Barb is an excellent violin teacher. As well as being a gifted musician, she has an extraordinary ability to 'read' her students and to help them build their confidence and musicianship along with their technical skills. Before working with Barb my son was discouraged and ready to quit music. Within a short period of time, Barb had helped him move past his block and charted a learning pathway that challenged and inspired him. He improved quickly and has gone further than I ever dreamed. Barb is warm, empathetic and disciplined and we are so fortunate to have her as a teacher and role model. I can't recommend her highly enough.

                <p>
                    Barb is a super nice and patient instructor. She helped me with how to manage school work and violin at the same time, which reduced a huge amount of stress and the skill of time management is helpful now in Post-Secondary.
                    <br><br>
                    She also sets up a plan for me of catching up in studies/études since I wasn’t quite on task in that area. Now that I am in Post-Secondary, the work and time put into the plan is showing an awesome result!

                    I'm glad I found a great teacher for my middle school age daughter. I think she pulls my daughter's interests and encourages her to push her abilities. Barbara is pretty bright and amazing teacher. I'd recommend Barbara to anyone who wants to learn violin regardless of age or skill level.
